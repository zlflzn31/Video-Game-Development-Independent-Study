# Video-Game-Development-Independent-Study


# Purpose

- Because I couldn't find any class that teaches about 3D game using Unreal Engine 4, I decided to create a class for myself. This independent study is supported by professor Baruah and professor Santos. 

- ## What I learned
  - OOP for high level game development
  - development of complicated AI behaviors, such as "Find Nearest Player" and "Move To Player" environmental queries to enable AI enemies to take the shortest path to a current player
  - Basic interactions between a player and enemies (damage, health, movement)
