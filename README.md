# Video-Game-Development-Independent-Study


1. Purpose
Because I couldn't find any class that teaches about 3D game using Unreal Engine 4, I decided to create a class for myself. This independent study is supported by Professor Baruah and Santos. 
Through this study, I will learn basic components of Unreal Engine 4 and how to develop a 3D FPS game and comprehend more about advanced C++.
